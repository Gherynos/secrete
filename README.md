# Secrete

Secrete is a simple ECIES implementation that uses [Curve25519](http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html).

The [Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Encryption_Scheme) has been implemented with the following specifications:

| Item                        | Specification                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Elliptic Curve              | Curve25519                          |
| Key Derivation Function     | KDF2                                |
| Message Authentication Code | HMAC with SHA512                    |
| Symmetric Encryption Scheme | AES-256 CBC mode with PKCS7 Padding |

## Binary version

The binary distribution can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/gherynos/secrete/releases) page.

## Usage

### Generate the key pair

```shell
java -jar secrete.jar genKeys
```

This will generate the two files `public.key` and `private.key` under the `.secrete` folder in the user's home.
A password will be required to protect the private key.

The private key is stored using PBKDF2 with SHA-512 and AES-256 CBC mode with PKCS7 Padding.

### Export the public key

```shell
java -jar secrete.jar -o <key_file> exportKey
```

### Encrypt a text message

```shell
java -jar secrete.jar -k <recipient_key_file> encrypt
```

Insert the message ending with a "."; the encrypted message will be displayed encoded in Base64.

It is also possible to output the encrypted message to a binary file by specifying the "-o" option:

```shell
java -jar secrete.jar -k <recipient_key_file> -o <encrypted_file> encrypt
```

### Decrypt a text message

```shell
java -jar secrete.jar decrypt
```

Insert the Base64 encrypted message, and the password to unlock the private key.

It is also possible to load the encrypted message from the binary file by specifying the "-i" option:

```shell
java -jar secrete.jar -i <encrypted_file> decrypt
```

### Encrypt a file

```shell
java -jar secrete.jar -k <recipient_key_file> -i <file_to_encrypt> -o <encrypted_file> encrypt
```

### Decrypt a file

```shell
java -jar secrete.jar -i <encrypted_file> -o <decrypted_file> decrypt
```

Insert the password to unlock the private key.
